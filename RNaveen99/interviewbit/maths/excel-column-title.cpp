// The problem is similar to converting a decimal number to its binary representation but instead of a binary
// base system where we have two digits only 0 and 1, here we have 26 characters from A-Z.
// So, we are dealing with base 26 instead of base binary.

// We donâ€™t have zero in this number system, as A represents 1, B represents 2 and so on Z represents 26. To
// make the problem easily understandable, we approach the problem in two steps:

// Convert the number to base 26 representation, considering we have 0 also in the system.
// Change the representation to the one without having 0 in its system.

// In Base 26 Number System to deal with zero, we borrow 26 and subtract 1 from the next significant bit.
